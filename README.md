Hello, welcome to my gpu tuning program, thank you for reading the readme.
Here are the steps for using it:
1. open the config.txt file, and put the filepath to your MSI afterburner config file, it should be somewhere in Program files (x86)/MSI Afterburner/Profiles,
put the path to the one with the really long mess of characters, mine is named VEN_1002&DEV_1636&SUBSYS_8760103C&REV_D3&BUS_3&DEV_0&FN_0, they all are different.
change all the backslashes (\\) in your filepath to either frontslashes (/) or two backslashes (\\\\), this is due to how c++ handles backslashes, they are a command
and a character at the same time
2. do the same for your fraps FRAPSLOG file, mine is C:/Fraps/Benchmarks/FRAPSLOG.txt, remember to change the backslashes here too
3. launch MSI Afterburner, OCCT (make sure it is in fullscreen mode), FRAPS, and UNIGINE Superposition
4. Put fraps in the bottom right corner, with just a sliver showing, it doesn't like being under other programs so it needs to be out of the way
5. Do what the program says
6. Come back in a while
7. Have Fun!


If you wanna know how it works it's pretty simple, it clicks on your screen, thats why I need OCCT in fullscreen, and why I even need other programs.
