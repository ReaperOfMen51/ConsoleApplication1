Hello, welcome to my gpu tuning program, thank you for reading the readme.
Here are the steps for using it:
1. open the config.txt file, and put the filepath to your MSI afterburner config file, it should be somewhere in Program files (x86)/MSI Afterburner/Profiles,
put the path to the one with the really long mess of characters, mine is named VEN_1002&DEV_1636&SUBSYS_8760103C&REV_D3&BUS_3&DEV_0&FN_0, they all are different.
change all the backslashes (\) in your filepath to either frontslashes (/) or two backslashes (\\), this is due to how c++ handles backslashes, they are a command
and a character at the same time
2. do the same for your fraps log file
3. launch MSI Afterburner, OCCT (make sure it is in fullscreen mode), FRAPS, and UNIGINE Superposition
4.
